I need to take some time to write this readme properly. At the moment I'm busy developing some other projects and my portfolio.

This project is for Porsche Brazil and is in the beta phase.
It's a simple project that consists of a user interface with a previous layout to be fulfilled by the car dealership.
The resultant image is automatically sent to the Toten screen, placed at the side of a Porsche Vehicle. 

At the backend, you can notice a simple integration with the magicInfo Samsung system API, responsible for the screen content management
